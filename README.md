# GrammarBoard

__IS__ a tool for English language learners. Just like toddlers put colored blocks into slots of the proper shape, GrammarBoard users learn both vocabulary and grammar in a similarly interactive manner--all without needing to know a word!

## Layout

## Execution:
0. seed database (sun., Day 0)
1. div grid & grammar board area; skeleton color-matching logic; random card population
2. draggability, flip effect, audio (I'll see what's out there)
3. shuffling cards; changing to a different grammar board

_(will research needed libraries)_

__After receiving feedback, can adapt accordingly to show off other JS functionality. Then, will update above with additional features.__
